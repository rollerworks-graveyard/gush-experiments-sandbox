pull-request:squash
-------------------

* Description: Squashes all commits of a pull request
* Usage:

  * `pull-request:squash [--no-local-sync] [--] <pr_number>`

The <info>pull-request:squash</info> command squashes all commits of a pull-request:

    <info>$ gush pull-request:squash 12</info>

Make sure you are the pull-requests\'s source-branch repository owner
or have been granted push access on the repository.

Note: This will squash all in the commits in pull-request and (when a local branch exists with
the same name) sync your local source-branch with the squashed version.

You can skip this sync-process using the <comment>--no-local-sync</> option.
