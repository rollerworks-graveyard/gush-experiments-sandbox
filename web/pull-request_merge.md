pull-request:merge
------------------

* Description: Merges the pull request given
* Usage:

  * `pull-request:merge [--no-comments] [--squash] [--force-squash] [--switch SWITCH] [--] <pr_number> [<pr_type>]`

The <info>pull-request:merge</info> command merges the given pull request:

    <info>$ gush pull-request:merge 12</info>

Optionally you can prefix the merge title with a type like: bug, feature or anything you like.
<comment>Using a type makes it easier to search for a such a PR-type in your git history.</comment>

    <info>$ gush pull-request:merge 12 bug</info>

If there are many unrelated commits (like cs fixes) you can squash all the commits in the
pull-request into one big commit using:

    <info>$ gush pull-request:merge --squash 12</info>

This will use the message-body and author of the first commit in the pull-request.

<comment>Note:</comment> Squashing a PR requires that all the commits in the pull-request were done by one author.
You can overwrite this behaviour with <comment>--force-squash</comment>

If the pull request was opened against the master branch as target, but you rather want to merge it into another branch,
like "development" you can use <comment>--switch</comment> to change the base when merging.

<comment>This will only merge the commits that are in the source branch but not in the original target branch!</comment>

    <info>$ gush pull-request:merge --switch=development 12</info>
